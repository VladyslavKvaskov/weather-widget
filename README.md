# weather-widget
A simple dynamic weather-widget svg using nextjs due to free Vercel hosting and openweatherapi.
It accepts same query params as https://openweathermap.org/current.
Also, the widget has a param to edit svg's viewBox attribute (the query param is name the same way "viewBox" where you have to pass four numbers e.g. `?viewBox=0 0 180 130`)

Here is what the widget looks like:
